# Explanation

This project is a 32-bit single-cycle processor.<br> Because of simulation resource limits, it doesn't run in one true hardware clock cycle.<br> Instead, the design completes every instruction (fetch, decode, execute, memory, write-back)<br> in a single software iteration before moving to the next instruction.

# Requirements

```sh
make

```

# Build 

```sh
git clone link of project
make
```
